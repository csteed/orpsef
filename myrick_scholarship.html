        <h2>Myrick Donation &amp; Scholarship</h2>
        <h3>Tim and Teresa Myrick Support Grants Campaign and Scholarship Programs</h3>
        <p>Tim Myrick’s work as a loan executive and later a volunteer in the Oak Ridge 
          High School renovation and rebuilding project led Tim and his wife Teresa 
          to contribute in support of academic studies dear to his heart. The couple made 
          a $25,000 pledge to the Foundation’s Making the Critical Difference Grants 
          Campaign. Of that amount, $15,000 was designated for ORHS Science Department 
          grants and $10,000 for scholarships for environmental science students. The 
          gift provides a $1,000 scholarship to an AP environmental science student each 
          year for 10 years. In 2013, the Science Department grant provided lab equipment 
          and digital cameras for microscopes.</p>

        <p>Tim’s involvement with the high school came after he guided the $350 
          million modernization undertaken by UT-Battelle at Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
          in the early 2000s, as project manager for the facilities revitalization 
          program. ORNL later offered Tim’s leadership talent to help guide the 
          complicated $61 million high school project, and Tim was eager to help. When 
          he retired from the lab in 2004, he continued as a volunteer consultant on 
          the project until completed in 2008.</p>

        <p>Noting Tim’s concerns for the environment and energy savings during rebuilding of 
          the high school, a science teacher invited him to come in as a volunteer teacher 
          in an AP environmental science class once a week. Tim has actively participated 
          in the AP environmental science course at Oak Ridge High School since 2008, 
          often giving lectures, participating in field studies or discussing 
          ongoing environmental management projects.  Noticing that teachers’ needs in 
          the classrooms and labs were often greater than budgets provided for, and that 
          some motivated students needed help with college expenses, he and his wife 
          decided to make the gift to the Foundation.</p>

        <h3>2014 Myrick AP Environmental Science Scholar</h3>
        <img class="img-thumbnail pull-right" src="img/scholarships/K_Cunningham.jpg" alt="Kristina Cunningham and Tim Myrick" hspace="10"/>
        <p>Kristina Cunningham enjoyed Tuesdays in her advanced placement environmental 
          science class, when guest lecturer Tim Myrick brought real-world examples 
          of environmental issues into the classroom. Tim noticed Kristina’s dedication to 
          her studies and commitment to environmental causes. He selected her to receive 
          the 2014 $1,000 AP environmental science scholarship that he and his wife 
          Teresa presented.</p>
      
        <p>"I have a strong passion to help the earth,"" Kristina commented on her interest 
          in environmental sciences. "We need to develop new technology to help bring 
          change. We’re all responsible for what’s going on, but I want to help bring 
          change."" A 2014 graduate of Oak Ridge High School, Kristina is continuing her studies in environmental engineering at Tennessee Tech University.</p>
     
        <p>"I selected Kristina because from the very first month in the AP environmental 
          science class, I could tell she was very committed to environmental causes, was 
          a dedicated student, and was very personable," Tim said. He added that he 
          could see that she would be an excellent college student and professional 
          engineer and a responsible advocate for environmental issues throughout her 
          life.</p>
