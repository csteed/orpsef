        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>To partially fund students attending Oak Ridge schools in exchange student programs/international meetings.

        <h3>Who is Eligible for the Scholarship?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Students attending Oak Ridge Schools with a grade average of B+ (3.50).
          <li>Graduates of ORHS currently attending college.
        </ul>

        <p>Priority of funding for students is (highest to lowest):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>high school senior</li>
            <li>high school graduate prior to going to college</li>
            <li>high school junior</li>
            <li>student enrolled in college</li>
            <li>high school sophomore</li>
            <li>high school freshman</li>
            <li>middle school student</li>
            <li>elementary school student</li>
          </ul>
        <p>No more than one scholarship will be awarded to any student during his/her lifetime.</p>
      
        <p>The application form should be returned with:
        <ul>
          <li>A one page essay describing why the student believes he/she should be selected for a scholarship and how he/she expects the experience will contribute to his/her future.
          <li>A brief, informal resume that provides information on the applicant's activities inside and outside school and any involvement in international programs or activities.
        </ul>
        
        <p>Also, the applicant should arrange for three references who will complete and deliver a letter of reference to the Oak Ridge Public Schools Education Foundation at the address at the end of this information sheet and on the application form by the application deadline. The references should be obtained from professional sources (excluding family) that are well acquainted with the applicant's educational background, intellectual abilities, jobs and volunteer experience, and personal character. 

        <p>The amount of scholarship funds available will vary from year to year. Applicants should apply for scholarships in the range of $500 to $2000.

        <h3>What Exchange Programs Can Be Funded?</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>An established exchange student program (such as AFS or Sister City).
           <li>An informal request to study abroad (any subject).  
        </ul>

        <p>The scholarship does not usually provide for total funding in order to encourage students to earn part of their funding as a life lesson. Exceptions to the partial-funding objective may be made for students who are disabled (but can still travel) or whose financial situation makes personal funding a hardship. Recipients may receive greater or total funding only if sufficient funds are available for that year. The Scholarship Committee may choose to select fewer students in order to provide greater funding for a qualified student who is disabled or in financial need. 

        <p>Funding is not for vacation or sightseeing trips, but for learning/educational trips, either during the school year or during the summer, and before or after high school graduation, as ascertained/approved by the Scholarship Committee.   

        <h3>What Other Programs Can Be Funded?</h3>
        <p>Discretionary funding is available, at the special approval of the Scholarship Committee, for attending/sponsoring international meetings designed to further a better understanding of other cultures/peoples, no matter what country hosts the meetings. A written request to the Scholarship Committee will initiate the consideration for funding.   
        <p>Qualifications for this type of funding are:  
        <ul>
          <li>Enrollment in an Oak Ridge school.
          <li>Good character, so as to be a credit to Oak Ridge schools. 
          <li>Filing a <a href="./files/Liability_Statement.pdf">Release of Liability form</a> for the Scholarship Fund and the Foundation.
          <li>Special approval by the Scholarship Committee. 
          <li>An agreement by the recipient that he/she will give at least one public talk/media release about the meeting attended and what was discussed/accomplished regarding international relations in order to help and educate others who did not attend meetings.   
        </ul>

        <h3>Nondiscrimination Policy</h3>
        <p>Students are to be selected without regard to gender, race, color, creed, religion, sexual preference, disability, politics, wealth, class/caste, or any other discriminatory issue.   

        <h3>For More Information</h3>
        <p><a href="./contact.html">Contact</a> the Oak Ridge Public Schools Education Foundation.</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
              <p>Studying and working with students at Hong Kong City University, Patricia 
              Garland viewed sustainability challenges and solutions through a new 
              lens. "Culturally, it was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. I had 
              never been able to work with other cultures in this capacity," said Patricia. 
              "It was fascinating."  Her crosscultural learning experience has provided 
              valued insights that will help her as she pursues a career in sustainability, 
              either working on a college campus or for a company in the private sector.  
              Now earning a master’s degree in sustainability from Arizona State University, 
              she encountered real challenges during her study abroad – decreasing 
              marine biodiversity affecting the fishing industry, and landfill space 
              quickly filling up while serving Hong Kong’s 7 million inhabitants. 
              Policy solutions, she learned, must take the political realities into 
              consideration.
